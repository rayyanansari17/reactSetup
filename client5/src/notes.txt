why react and not HTML?

while everything we can do in plain HTML, CSS, JS, react allows:
-- better code reuse
-- large scale performance in poroduction 
-- clean separation of concern via components 
-- easier maintainance and testing


Folder Structure:

industry standard Folder Layout:

src
|-- components/  # reusable UI components
|-- pages/       # Page-specific components
|-- utils/       # constants, helpers and mock data


src = source folder. All app logic should reside here 
you are free to structure folders as you like, but the industry typically follows this convention



.jsx vs .js which one for components ?4

✅ use .jsx for files containing JSX 
    const MyComponents= ()=>{
        return <h1>Hello,JSX</H!>;
    };
    export default MyComponent;

Pros of .jsx:
    - Clarity :indicates the presence of JSX
    - Better editor support (highlighting, lifting)
    - Matches community convention 

⚠️ You can use .js but ...
cons:
    -misleading for JSX-containing files
    -may confuse older tooling
    -less expresssive in files lists 

    ✅ Best Practice:
    Use .jsx for components
    Use .js for utilities, config and non-JSX logic

:: Importing files in React

You can import like this:
    import Header from "./components/Header.jsx     // you can skip the extension

    Note: The .jsx extension is optional while importing

Constant and static data 
    dont keep large static data or hardcoded strings inside the component 

    instead extract from utils/

    // utils/constants.js

    export const CDN_LINK = "https://cdnlink.com"
    export const URL = "https://suhail.app"




    //utils/mockdata.js

    const data = [
        {
            //complete large data set
        }
    ];


    export default data;


Export tips:

Named Exports

//constants.js
export const CDN_LINK = "https://cdnlink.com"
export const URL = "https://suhail.app"

//Usage
  import {CDN_LINK, URL} from "../utils/constans";


Default Export 

//mockdata.jsexport default data;


//Usage
import data from "../utils/mockdata";

File Size Guideines:
in companies like UBER, fie length best practice:
    Avoid flie slonger than 100 lines
    if you exceed that, refactor into smaler components or files 

follow these practices to keep your react project clean,scaleable and production ready!
